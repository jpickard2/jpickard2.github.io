Hello, I'm Joe.  
I studied biochemistry in undergrad, immunology in grad school and my current research is focused on microbiology. Specifically, I'm interested in the bacteria that inhabit our gut and how they protect us from infections and interact with each other. Outside of that, I enjoy photography, especially macro photography of tiny things like insects and slime molds (see my [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/joseph54pickard)).
I'll use this site to document my miscellaneous projects, in order to keep track of what I do and to force myself to bring each project to a presentable state of completion. Maybe the information will be useful or interesting to someone else as well!
