Hi, I'm Joe.  
I studied biochemistry in undergrad, immunology in grad school and my current postdoctoral research is focused on microbiology. Specifically, I'm interested in the bacteria that inhabit our gut and how they protect us from infections and interact with each other. Outside of that, I enjoy photography, especially macro photography of tiny things like insects and slime molds (see my [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/joseph54pickard)).  
I'll use this site to document my many other miscellaneous projects. I'm always trying to learn new skills and make cool things that combine art and science.
