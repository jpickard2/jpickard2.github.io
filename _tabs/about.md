Hi, I'm Joe.  
I studied biochemistry in undergrad, immunology in grad school and my current postdoctoral research is focused on microbiology. Specifically, I'm interested in the bacteria that inhabit our gut (the *gut microbiota*) and how they protect us from infections, and interact with one another. Outside of that, I enjoy photography, especially macro photography of tiny things like insects and slime molds (see my Instagram: @joseph54pickard). I'll use this site to document my many miscellaneous projects. I'm always trying to learn new skills and do cool projects that bridge art and science.
