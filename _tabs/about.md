Hi, I'm Joe.  
I studied biochemistry in undergrad, immunology in grad school and my current research (while it lasts) is focused on microbiology. Specifically, the bacteria that inhabit our gut (the *gut microbiota*) and how they protect us from infections, and interact with one another. Outside of that, I enjoy photography, especially macro photography of tiny things like insects and slime molds (see my Instagram: @joseph54pickard). I'll use this site to document my continuous collection of miscellaneous projects. In general, I like to learn new skills and try to do cool things that bridge art and science.
